- 👋 Hi, I’m @paulobear
- 👀 I’m interested in developing full stack React Native applications using AWS Amplify for backend and draftbit for initial cut at the frontend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ***everything***! But most recently I figured out how to automagically update the backend using the return cleanup from useEffect hook and to re-render using the useIsFocused hook.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - well, I'm pretty much used up on my current project.
